Quest: Chapter 1 Day 2


What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

1.	Safety and Security
2.	Clarity
3.	Approachability
4.	Developer Experience 
5.	Resource Oriented Programming 

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

1.	Safety and Security: This is useful because safe and security are both key concerns in any form of transaction and the fact this is number one is very reassuring. 
2.	Clarity: This is useful because a lot of people like getting straight to the point on things and not beating around the bush. 
3.	Approachability: This is useful because it will make it easier to not overwhelm people who are looking to make a switch or start fresh.
4.	Developer Experience: This is useful because it will allow an easier review process of things.
